Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first equilibrium point in an array. 
Equilibrium point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.
Note: Return equilibrium point in 1-based indexing. Return -1 if no such point exists. 

Example 1:
Input: 
n = 5 
A[] = {1,3,5,2,2} 
Output: 
3 
Explanation:  
equilibrium point is at position 3 as sum of elements before it (1+3) = sum of elements after it (2+2)
